"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",Bought this for my daughter who is expecting her first baby. She said her friends said it is the one item that she absolutely must have! Easy to put on. Now just waiting for the baby!,5
Child to Cherish Handprints Tower Of Time Kit in Pink,"A perfect baby or first birthday gift. I received two myself as gifts.  I just finished one for my 5 year-old.  The last handprint. :(Perfect packaging, fast shipping.",5
CM Star Candy Heart Crossbody Shoulder Bag Satchel Purse Handbag Clutch,"It is very cute, and I got a lot of compliments.Pros-Really cuteCan hold my galaxy phone + walletHas a separate outside zipper for keys etcCons-It is a little heavy/clinky with the metal chain strap, but the strap also makes it look really coolIt swings around when I move so it's not very portableThere is a small decorative chain hanging from the bottom that is kind of long and is slightly noisy when it bangs on your legs when walkingIt's made well and is super cute though, and I would recommend it.",4
"JJ Cole Collections System Diaper Bag, Black Damask","I have had 3 of these bags - i love it so much.  I have had one with each of my children.  It holds everything.  It hangs great on the back of the stroller.  It's stylish and just great.  But the zipper has broke on each of my bags.  One of the bags actually tore along the seam. I would recommend the bag, because the poor quality hasn't made the bag impossible to use.  I do love it.  If I have another baby, I admit, I might get another one of these bags!",3
Recaro Signo Convertible Car Seat Midnight Desert,I have used this with both my kids. It is the best car seat on the market and lasts through different stages!,5
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,This is the best monitor- better than the regular monitors and than the angelcare monitor. You can see and hear your baby. The bad rewiews I read are from people who don't use commom sense. To set up your camera - have the monitor in the room with you so you can see what the camera is seeing- then take it to where you want to view your baby. You don't have to go back and forth 100 times. The reception is clear-- if it isn't -- change the channel. If there is feedback from the speaker- the volume is too high. The many problems people have are easily solved if you use your brain. I can't believe this monitor isn't reviewed at 5 stars across the board. I give it my 2 thumbs up and take comfort that I can see my baby is sleeping safe.,5
"3 Sprouts Storage Caddy, Mouse","This is my second caddy...I also have the walrus...liked it so much, I bought a second one...the walrus I use as a diaper caddy...I cloth diaper and it holds 3 diapers, wipes, hand sanitizer, diaper cream, as well as misc baby items (nail clippers, colic drops, etc) all in the main part...I am able to slip TV and heater remote in outside pockets, but if main caddy is full, the outer pockets feel tight...In the beaver caddy, I have floor and tummy time toys, a few Dr. Seuss books, teethers, rings, etc. When you first use it, it takes a bit for the bottom to lay flat, but once it does it will stand on its own.",4
Nuby 2 Pack Replacement Silicone Spouts,"I wish there was more photos/info about which models these fit. I searched the cups they were intended for and could find no model number on them (and of course I didn't keep the packaging - who does?), so assumed they were correct. Wrong! I'm out 2 bucks - they don't fit any I own.",3
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","I like the contours, keeps baby safer on the table.  Waterproof is true, needs a cover though because the plastic is crinkly and cold.",5
"Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White","We needed a crib for our grandson's visit and I liked the fact that many now grow with the child, turning into a toddler bed, daybed or full-size bed's headboard/footboard. I picked this particular crib because of the great product reviews and it seemed (and is) very sturdy. It arrived quickly and the packaging was excellent. It had been a while since we've had to assemble furniture so it took us a little while to put together. It was not too difficult, but definitely a two-person job. When my daughter saw it, she loved it - even more than the one she has!",5
"JOTO Premium Screen Protector Film Anti Glare, Anti Fingerprint (Matte Finish) for All New Kindle Fire HD 7 inch Tablet (will only fit All New Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; 2013 released), with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3 Pack)",These screen protectors were easy to apply and no issue with getting the few air bubbles out.  Would buy again.,5
"Mountain Buggy Urban Jungle Stroller, Black Dot","I bought the Urban Jungle after extensive research... and love it!We were looking for a tough but stylish stroller that was suitable for the city, running, hiking trails and light enough to get in and out of a NYC cab.Great stroller! And the bassinet is perfect for a newborn.",5
Munchkin Bobble Bee Suction Toy,Very cute and keeps your baby entertained during meals.  The only reason why I am giving this a 4 is because the toy removes from the suction cup base very easily.  My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and can remove it quite easily.  I'd prefer it to stay stationary while I am feeding her and not have to worry about having to reattach it to the base multiple times during each meal.,4
Kidsline Zanzibar Musical Mobile,"Our baby loves this thing but it drives me CRAZY!!!  First of all, it should be battery operated because the wind-up motor doesn't last nearly long enough.  The other annoying thing is the stupid giraffe (which isn't even my baby's favorite animal, she likes the zebra) always getting caught on the post which supports the mobile.  This stops the mobile from turning and slows the music, they should have angled the post a little more over the crib so it doesn't get stuck like that.  Even with these two unfortunate problems, my baby LOVES this thing when it is working, it totally captivates her.  She is only a month old though, so maybe she will soon be annoyed like me.",3
Eco Sprout Detergent 48 oz. - Lavender / Chamomile,"I have tried several other varieties of detergent, and this is by far my favorite!  No &#34;off-smelling&#34; diapers any more!  It rinses clean and we haven't had to strip at all since switching.",5
"JJ Cole Lite Embroidered Bundleme, Pink, Infant",This product is very pretty but does not fit the Graco Safe Seat as it is too narrow and short for it.,1
"Medela Disc Collar, Slow Flow Nipple, and Clear Bottle Cap Replacement parts","this nipple is very good, the only thing that it made me give four is that it doesnt help with spit up but other than that its excellent",4
NuAngel Washable Nursing Pads 100% Cotton - Natural - 8 pads - Made in U.S.A.,"First time using these instead of disposable pads, and wish I would've discovered them sooner. They are softer and if you don't leak, they don't need to be changed as often. They don't stick, but also don't move around much-fine if you have a bra on, but don't stay in place as well with loose pajamas. Already bought a set for a gift.",5
Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,"I love these organic wipes! You can't beat the price, about a dollar a piece. I ordered some of the double sided wipes from Charlie Banana, and even though they are thicker, they are made of one side organic cotton, one side 100% polyester :S... These are just one piece of organic cotton with a hem.. A little thinner, but so soft and will get the job done.  Definitely recommend!",5
The Piggyback Rider Standing Child Carrier - NILOC Model,"Preparing to take my daughter who is 4 to the Olympics, I needed to find a way to carry her that would result in no neck pain for me and no need to visit a Chiropractor. As a single Mom I needed to find something that I could use by myself, and easily worked out a way that I could strap in my daughter as well as put her safely on in the rider.Pros:Awesome view for my daughterEase of Access : A stroller in this situation would be a nightmare with many restrictions for accessEasy Stored in a Back Pack (tho the bag you ship makes NO Sense to me)Cons:My daughter got tired standing up, and after about 4hrs we resulted to my shouldersHard to distribute weight to my hips and found that standing bar bumped against my buttAlot of attention - everybody wanted to know where to get one!",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,This is well made and the bright colors attract my daughter's attention. If it was a little less expensive I would have given it 5 stars.,4
"Woombie Convertible Baby Swaddler (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Little Monster)",The quality of this item is pretty good. Fabric feels light and stretchy. I like the zipper up top and on bottom (diaper changes should be easier this way) Unfortunately there's no way I could zip up all the way to my 9-pound baby's neck.(the item was the newborn > 13 pound size) The neck opening is just way too tight. Thank heavens for Amazon's great return policy.,2
Jeep 2-in-1 Baby Carrier,"My 1 month old son loves to be held and this carrier lets me meet his needs for closeness while still having hands free for the other kids or housework.  I am a mother of 4 and have tried every carrier on the market except the very expensive baby bjorn.  They were all complicated to use and weren't comfortable.I went to Babies-R-Us finally prepared to spend $100.00 on a baby bjorn.  While hesitating for one moment, I tried on this carrier and loved it even more than the baby bjorn.  It is VERY EASY TO USE.  We have only used it in the forward facing position so far.  One buckle on each side secures the carrier to the parent.  Then one slide lock buckle on each side secures the baby.  There is also a buckle on each side near the top to ensure lots of comfy head support for newborns.  It is very user friendly.  I also love that it does not have a waist strap.My husband is 6'2"" amd weighs about 240 pounds.  This carrier has straps plenty long enough to fit him and people much larger (or smaller).I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY THIS CARRIER!!!",5
The First Years Take and Toss 28-Piece Feeding Variety Pack,"I got this for a friend who doesn't know if they are having a boy or girl along with a really cute bib. I personally own these and think they are great! We use them on an every day basis, but if you lose a piece you aren't upset because they are so inexpensive.",5
"Pearhead Babyprints Desk Frame, Mahogany","This product was great.  The footprint kit was so easy, and it just has to dry for a good day, and then its ready to frame.  definatly reccomend this product.",5
Levana ClearVu Digital Video Baby Monitor with Color Changing Night Light (LV-TW301),"Not a clear night vision picture, bad audio quality. If i had an option I'd buy the Levana discont. product, babyview, way better.",2
"Skip Hop Hug and Hide Activity Toy, Owl","Love this owl so much, I have purchased it three times in the past year. Both Moms and babies loved receiving this!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I purchased this pumping bra after extensively reading others' reviews. I've used it for about a month and I love it. I work at a really busy office, and couldn't really afford to lose 15 minutes a few times a day to sit and pump. This truly lets me be hands free and I can work on the computer or do paperwork while pumping. It does take a little getting used to. The first time I used it, I think it took 10 minutes to get myself situated. I've got it down to about a minute now. It's very customizable, which is part of the learning curve up front, but means nearly everyone should be able to use it. I'm 36D/size 10-12 in most things and purchased the XS/S/M; it fits fine with a little room for expanding outward if I needed to and a LOT of room for making it smaller.",4
Oopsy Daisy Fine Art for Kids NL190401MG Train Engine Night Light,I bought this for my son's room since he likes trains. I expected better quality for the amount it cost. All it is a picture sitting on top of a nightlight. It wiggles and has fallen off a couple of times. It's cute but it is not worth the money they charge for it.,3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",this was the perfect gift for my nephew to brighten up his room at night.  It is very cute and useful too,5
Nuby 2-Pack 8 oz No Spill Cup with Super Spout (Color may vary),"This was the 2nd sippy cup I bought. It leaks, the plastic spout part comes apart from the cup. Worst design.",2
"Dutailier Ultramotion Bow Back Glider Rocker and Ottoman Combo, Sage","I just got this put together.  The first thing I noticed and aspect I can't get rid of is the smell.  The varnish or stain used on the wood is overwhelming.  I hope it is not dangerous or harmful.  There are no instructions for assembly and left over parts.  There is nothing in the packaging or on the product that states ""Dutailier.""  The only thing that says Dutailier is the box, which makes me wonder if this is a knock off.  I will be calling Dutailier Monday to verify.  It is gliding quietly but the ottoman feels like it is going to fall apart.  I have to run, the smell is making me dizzy.",2
American Red Cross Door Finger Guard - 2 Pack,Product arrived prompt and in great condition. My little one and a half year old thinks she is much older and likes to run around in the bedrooms and close the doors behind her. I like to keep her room open so having these finger gaurds are great because not only do they prevent her from hurting herself but they keep the door from getting closed. Win win situation. Thanks,4
Mother-Ease Sandy's Cloth Diaper - Bamboo - Small (8-20 lbs),"Just thinking about a little 20# baby in this thing makes me laugh... But the size works for my baby beast, who was already 36"" and 32# at 18 months... All the other cloth diapers and wraps were fitting him like teeny bikini briefs. The high rise and extra room for stuffing with hemp inserts make it perfect for nighttime protection, when paired with Engel or Disana wool (which are probably the only covers that are big enough to cover this whole diaper, anyway).Just the high rise alone makes me happy... Having a tall baby can be difficult sometimes, because it seems like almost all baby stuff is designed for short lard balls.",5
Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Test Strips,These strips are great! I can have a glass of wine with dinner and be reassured that my baby's not having one too. Takes all the guessing out! Best invention ever... if you're nursing and like to have a drink now & then.,5
Teething Necklace Jewelry - Organic BPA Free Silicone Chew Beads Teether Toys for Nursing Moms - Tiffany - White,"This is a very cute necklace that is also a teething necklace.  It is so nice looking.  No one would guess it was a teething necklace. If you have a little one, you might want to check this out.",5
Motorola Digital Audio Baby Travel Monitor,I've used this twice and both times it's worked great.  Even when the child unit is across the room from her I can hear if she wakes up.  It's almost too good. When set on high at both ends my family could hear everything we were saying in the bedroom.  Remember to unplug it when not in use ;-),5
"Munchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Vary","Other than holding the pieces to the Dr. Brown bottles, nothing came out clean and this really wasn't worth the money.I use the Avent microwave sanitizer and continue to use the hot dishwasher cycle first. Disappointing.",1
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,These bibs seem like they will last a very long time. Get the job done and just throw them in the washer machine when dirty :) I bought some for both grandparents! Highly recommend.,5
Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 2 Parent Units,I was able to hear noises being made a room away from where the base was located-- which was a good thing and speaks to the quality of the system.,5
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","My granddaughter, two and a half months, holds on to this little caterpillar and don't loose her paci'. Beautiful. So glad I bought it. Might buy more in different designs. One of these little gifts a new Moms at times can't justify buying, a great gift for grandparents if baby uses this kind of pacifier. Very well made. Recommend!",5
Stokke Xplory Cup Holder,"I thought it was a little much to buy this fancy cup holder after spending so much on the Stokke Stroller, but it has been a necessity for our walks since the stroller is so streamlined, there really isn't any other place to put things right in front of you.  I use it for my phone a lot more than I use it for drinks, because I always like to have my phone handy in case of an emergency with the baby.",5
"Stephan Baby Ultra Soft and Huggable Musical Praying Woolly Lamb, Blue","arrived as advertised....good soft product.  Only difference, it was a little smaller than I had expected.  Overall I was pleased.",4
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",Love! Keeps his attention for hours. Does not hook on his car seat tho which is why I purchased it,4
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","I love this carseat.  I actually went to have it professionally installed, and the technician said it was the easiest-to-install seat EVER with the click-tight installation technology.  She was a fan of this seat.HOWEVER, the reason I did not give it 5 stars was because (after I purchased it), I read that it had dropped in rank in car seat ratings AS A BOOSTER.  It's still great as a 5-point harness seat.  As a booster, however, the change in the armrest design (from the Frontier 85) makes the lap belt sit too high on the child's lap.  Britax sells a ""SegureGuard"" clip to fix this, which we purchased for when we convert to a booster.  I feel the clip is something you should have anyway, to prevent submarining in boosters.Please check for yourself on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety website (IIHS).  They test and rate all the carseats & boosters.",4
Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"This was suggested by a friend and it took me a while to get it. I didn't think a stool to squat would help me poop anymore than the myriad of prunes I'm told to eat.OH OH OH how I was wrong. Since I have had this, i have had NO constipation. Put your feet up there and boom, out it comes. Works with my kids and i highly highly suggest it!",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow Replacement Cover - Mauve,"Got this for my wife as a gift during her pregnancy.  She loved it.  I tried it out and loved it as well.  If you like the idea of a body pillow, but didn't like actually using one of the straight ones, this is for you.  If you're a cuddly or curl-up-to-sleep person, THIS IS A GODSEND!",5
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump with On the Go Tote,"I have been using this pump heavily for a year (full time working mom).  I have also owned the Avent ISIS Duo and an older style Medela PISA (circa 1990). Tthe 1990's Medela was the best.  It lasted through 3 kids worth of heavy, heavy pumping and was a work horse.  But they don't make 'em like that anymore, so pining away after it doesn't really help anyone!SUMMARY:If you are going to pump exclusively, you will need a good DOUBLE electric pump.  Depending on your situation, below are my recommendations:If you are have low supply, if you're struggling to pump enough, and/or do not respond to the pump well, I would recommend the ISIS over the PISA.  The ISIS is much better at extracting milk, BUT, it's also more cumbersome to use, the parts are heavy (so won't work great with a pumping bra) and there are a lot of parts to clean and keep track of.If you have good supply and your body responds well to pumping, then this Medela will probably be a decent (and convenient) pump for you.If you are OCD about cleanliness: Isis or Ameda Purely Yours (closed systems)IF YOU WANT THE GORY DETAILS (#5 being the most important, IMO)1. Reliability is questionable.  The pump stopped working after 4 months.  However, Medela immediately sent out a new pump, for free, which I receved the next business day.  Very good customer service.  Unfortunately, this happened on a Friday, so I was without the pump for an entire weekend.  I was lucky enough to have a back up pump, but not everyone has access to a back up pump.  Without a back up pump, it would have been pretty horrible.2. The suction is just so-so.  Even when both pumps were brand new, I could hear the motor leaking air.  I replaced the membranes, and the suction is improved marginally.  I respond very well to the pump, so this doesn't jeopardize my production.  However, if you don't respond well to the pump, it might affect your supply.3. The parts are light and easy to keep clean.  Compared to the Avent Isis Duo, the Medla parts are much lighter, there are fewer pieces to assemble, and the pieces are more durable.  The Isis had a few silicone parts that got gunky and gross after a while.  But all the Medela parts are plastic except the membranes, which are inexpensive to replace.  Also, the weight makes the Medela very easy to hold up with a pumping bra.  The Isis was so heavy, my pumping bra wasn't very effective keeping the horns attached to my boobs. So I had to hold them there and wasn't able to multi task while pumping.  Very inconvenient.4.  This is an open system.  Milk WILL get in the tubes. Dust and condensation will also gunk up the tubes.  If you're super OCD about everything being perfectly clean and sterile, be prepared to replace the tubing often.  Alternatively, look into closed system pumps (Isis and Ameda Purely Yours are closed). You will need to run your pump for a few minutes after each use to dry out the tubes or else mold will develop.  Kind of a pain, and this puts added wear on the motor (which is already weak, IMO, per my above comments).  You will need to replace the tubes every so often.  This also means it's only intended for one user.  This doesn't stop many people from buying used pumps, but technically, that is considered unsanitary and voids the warranty.5. You cannot control the speed and suction independent of each other.  There is a single dial.  If you set the dial to &#34;low&#34; = low suction, slow speed.  &#34;High&#34; = high suction, fast speed.  You cannot have low suction, fast speed.  Or high suction, slow speed.  On the ISIS, Ameda and old style Medela you can control the speed and suction separately.  This is an important feature, because each woman has a different combination of speed and suction they respond best to. And if you're struggling to produce, you need every advantage you can get and being able to completely customize the speed and suction could be a determining factor in your success. I always got the most milk using the ISIS with slow speed and long deep suction.  I could pump about 15-20% more using the ISIS.  But I had ample supply, so even with the Medela, I could keep up with my baby's demand.For me, the deciding factor in using the Medela as my primary pump was convenience.  But if I was struggling with supply, I would have used the ISIS as my primary pump.As a side note, you can pump directly into Evenflo and Dr. Brown's narrow neck bottles.  I used the Evenflo glass bottles and Medela collars and nipples.  Worked great.",3
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"I bought 2 of these. One to keep at my parent's house and one to throw in my bag when we are out. I love them. It's the perfect thing for my parents..My son visits a few times week and they can easily store this in their linen closet, no big, clunky potty, when he's not there. It folds up into quarters, so I have no problems carrying one in my bag around either. (admittedly, though, I do carry a huge bag) I keep it with a pack of Clorox wipes and just give it a good wipe down in between uses. The bag I store it in is machine washable so I toss that in the laundry once a week. I'd highly recommend this to anyone.",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,"I've been really impressed with this pump. I'm pumping exclusively due to having a preemie in the NICU and I can get more per pump from the Avent than the madela pumps they have at the hospital. The only thing that didn't work for me was the silicone massage insert that prevented good suction so I simply removed them and have had no problems since. I've been pumping every three hours for the last 2 weeks so I can't speak of how long the motor will last but so far no issues at all. It's easy to clean and put together and the bag it comes in is nice, but the bag is the size of a computer/messenger bag so if small is what you're looking for then beware of the size",5
HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,I bought this for my older son when we were caught at a mall without any activities in my bag.  It has been a great distractor & teether for 2 babies now - and I see no signs that it will give out anytime soon!  We love HaBa products!!!,5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White",I  love this gate! I  have tried MANY different types  and they  didn't seem sturdy  enough in our walk thru.  This one  is very sturdy on easy to open and close.  Worth every penny!,5
"OXO Tot Sprout Chair, Orange/Birch","As the grandmother, I didn't really need a super fab highchair, since my grand-daughter is only here now and then -BUT this is the best!! By the time I bought this one my grand-daughter was 2 and she can climb in and out of it easily.The tray is nice and big, so it accommodates various plate sizes. Before long, we can just convert it to be a chair youpull up to the table, without the tray and center leg divide. I actually bought a second one for my son, since he recognizedhow much easier and SAFER it was than the smaller one he had.",5
Munchkin A&amp;H Disposable Multi-Use Pad - 20 Pack,"I use these with every dirty diaper change. If there's any mess, it makes it so easy to just wrap it all up and toss it! I keep a box on his changing table for at home, and I always keep some in his diaper bag for travel, too. I don't like to use public changing tables, so I change him in the car and just use one of these on the seat underneath him. They work like a charm!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","Exactly what was expected,  love that it is adjustable.  Good quality.  I am able to work and pump at the same time which is a lifesaver.",5
KidCo Angle Mount Safeway  - Black,I am very pleased with my decision to purchase two of these gates (top and bottom of stairs). The gate is very solid and is easy to operate one-handed. I like how you can limit to swing open only one direction.,5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black",Love how deep the cup holders are! Perfect and secure on my Baby Jogger City Select.  I also tuck the magnet center flap in sometimes to have the middle section stay open... I can hear my cell phone better that way.,5
Bummis Tote Bag - Red - Small,The size of the bag is fine but the opening is very narrow with very little give to it. It's hard to stuff a poopy diaper with minimal touching of your hand and/or the edge of the bag.,3
"Orbelle 3-6T Toddler Bed, Natural","We've been using this for a few months now. It was easy for myself and my 3 year old to put together (she helped hold the boards while I attached them).I'm sure there's a weight limit and some reviews had said that even leaning on it cause issues. For us, I'm average weight, but currently pregnant (so not so average weight)  and I've sat on the bed with my toddler and with my three year old many times and it's fine. My husband is also average and he often leans on it when he puts our child to sleep. Again, I'm sure there is a weight limit that we've exceeded, so I wouldn't say to do that, but our experience is that it holds.I do wish we had one that had the rail run the full length of the bed on one side, but that is just preference. Thought I'd mention it as a consideration, but has nothing to do with the quality of the bed.It's affordable and we have no complaints.",5
Classy Kid Keep Me Coloring Creative Germ Defense Placemat - Pack of 20,"These are perfect for my toddler who can't be trusted with a dish yet. I don't mind if a plastic plate or bowl hits the floor at home, but restaurants all use breakable plates that I really don't want to worry about being thrown by my little one. At the same time, having worked in the restaurant biz myself, I know how gross those tables might be. I certainly wouldn't want to eat my own food off of one. And my kid is also too young to really do well with the little coloring sheets/ kids menus you get at a lot of places. She doesn't have the coordination yet to keep the paper in place while she colors.These placemats neatly solve both problems. They stick well, the pictures are great for coloring or for talking about (""What sound does the cow make?"", etc) while we're trying to keep her entertained during the wait for food. I love the fact that these do not used licensed characters, and they are not gender-segregated. And being biodegradable is the extra-awesome icing on the cake. I've just placed my second order of these. I know we'll eventually outgrow using these, but for now, they are definitely a must-have for our family.",5
"Munchkin Swaddle Angel 2 Count Blankets, X-Batik and Boomerang","i bought these as a gift, and I was very pleased with the packaging.  My sister loves them for her new baby and uses them often.  They are large and soft, and the patterns are even prettier in person.  The best part are the loops that allow you to hook the blanket and keep it in place, and even use as a nursing cover.  I wish I had these when my babies were born!",5
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","I've had my gate at the top of the stairs for a year and a half or so and the safety latch that prevents the door from swinging both ways just snapped off.  I thought this would be an easy piece to replace as it only has two screws on it to remove in order to take it off and could be easily switched out; however, summer infant does not sell a replacement part for this item.  They want you to buy the whole gate in order to replace a small piece of plastic.  Unfortunately, I tried a few other gates at the top of my stairs and this was the only one that fit.  Please keep this in mind before purchasing this gate.",1
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1","I've been using Osocozy prefolds ever since my daughter was born. At almost 1 year old and just under 20 lbs, she can still fit into the size 1 prefolds (i use the jelly roll fold and secure with a snappi to make the trimmest fit possible). Size 2 was way too big and I actually cut 4 inches of length off of all of them (after prepping them, of course) and stitched the edges to prevent fraying. There is no way any baby would ever utilize all that extra length. I use Thirsties duo wraps and compared to a size 2 completely unbuttoned thirsties cover, the size 2 prepped prefolds were 5 inches longer than the cover.They are very absorbent, resistant to stains, and get very clean in the wash. I have recommended these prefolds to friends.",4
"Combi BPA Free Teether, 6 Months","I like the fact that it has a carrying case. It's a bit thinner than the other teethers like Munchkins, Nuby, etc.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",This is a great walker because it's easy to maneuver. My son loves being in it. I love that you could pop off the the musical play thing and it becomes a food tray. That is a plus for me cause it keeps him busy while I get chores done.,5
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","I have tried five different potty seats, and this is easily the best.  We have an elongated oval toilet, and this seat fits perfectly without slipping.  Next favorite is the Baby Bjorn seat...but is double the price of the Prince Lionheart.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Fantastic product. We absolutely love this for our 19-month-old; the tray system is easy to clean and so compact. My only regret? That we didn't get it months ago!,5
"My Brest Friend Original Pillow, Bluebells","After one week of trying to breastfeed with a stack of four pillows, my back was killing me.  I was getting less nervous about dropping the baby off the precariously balanced stack, but still limited in where I could sit while feeding (not in bed, because the floor was too far away).  Not having a nursing pillow was not working out.My Brest Friend is the only nursing pillow I've tried.  It is a huge improvement over standard bed pillows or nothing.Plusses:- Much better than a stack of standard bed pillows or just holding baby up with no pillows.  Within three feedings, I felt much better about using the pillow, and my back did not hurt some much after feeding.  This is way more comfortable than any improvised home alternatives.- Cheaper than buying waterproof covers for a stack of standard bed pillows.  After all, if you have a baby on it, eventually, there will be a diaper leak.  I didn't care what color the cover on the nursing pillow was, so I just picked the color that was on sale.Negatives:- The cover for the My Brest Friend is not waterproof, and the inside pillow material is made of foam that absorbs moisture.  If you have a baby on it, eventually, there will be a diaper leak.  That's going to go through the cover and into the pillow.  You can pat the foam with water, but the pillow will be wet for a while, and eventually I suspect the baby will start to smell the accumulated spills.  I realize that most of the manufacturing cost for this is the material used for the cover, but any type of waterproof layer, even a cheap vinyl cover under the cloth would have been very welcome.-  Boppy has a waterproof cover www.amazon.com/Boppy-Water-Resistant-Protective-Cover/dp/B002WDEIVA/ , but I couldn't even find one for sale separately for My Brest Friend.- I have to hunch over to nurse with this, or lift the baby's head a few inches off the pillow.  For perspective, I'm 5ft 6inch, have a long torso, wore size 8 before pregnancy and only gained 10 pounds from pregnancy.  The other reviewer who mentioned hunching over said she was 4ft something with a slight build.  In a sense, it's a one-size-fits-all pillow, and plus size reviewers say it's great for them.  With thicker thighs, the height might work out better.  Maybe I'm supposed to have my feet up on something, so that I can control the height of the pillow with my thighs.  That sort of works, but it angles the pillow so that baby slides into me, and it's alarming for both of us.Other:- I suspect a nursing pillow is only for the newborn phase.  Once the baby develops neck muscles, I think he will be able to do more of the work supporting himself up.  Also, people breast feed in public with nursing covers, but I have never seen someone carrying a nursing pillow around for portable breastfeeding.  So, I suspect the nursing pillow is for short term use, and will be outgrown in a few months.  This may mitigate issues with not having a waterproof cover.If you plan to breastfeed, definitely get a nursing pillow.  This one was a huge improvement over standard bed pillows, and a big enough improvement that I am not going to try others.  As you shop, if you see any nursing pillows that have a waterproof cover, or any waterproof covers for popular pillows, those are worth investigating and paying more for.",4
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet",absolutely waste of time and money!!!!  garbage instruction and product!!!  Not clear how to assemble and the assembly guide is ridiculously useless!!!!  The parts were damaged easily during assembly!!!!!  DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL!!!,1
Tiny Love Super Mat,"We have no carpeting in our house so I bought this interactive mat for my 5 month old. I put a foam mat underneath and it's soft enough for my baby to fall over and not cry. When my baby isn't playing with toys on this mat, she'll get distracted with the textures on the mat or the other attachments.",5
Kidsline - Luxury Blanket - Lavender,"These blankets are AMAZING.  They wear very well, my daughter has used the green one every night for over four years.  I bought two others, thinking the green one would wear out, but it hasn't.  These are super soft, wash very well and there is no fraying.  Awesome baby gift.",5
*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Lemon - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/&quot;THE ART OF CURETM&quot; Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"Well, the first one broke so I left a negative review. However, I was promptly emailed and given the certificate of authenticity and a promise to send me a new one. Hopefully the first one was just a fluke. I will revise if the second one breaks. But I tell you what, customer service was GREAT. She's a homeopathic mom who has a few trusted manufacturers. And she wanted to do anything possible to help me and my teething son. I am thrilled and that is why I am giving a second necklace a try.",5
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum",Great car seat except in the rear facing position you have to buy the angle adjuster (sold separately) in order to not push the passenger seat all of the way forward.,4
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","I loved these shades until it got cold here in Pa, and they won't stick now. Not worth buying if they don't work for more than half a year. Especially since it is very sunny in the winter time and my kids hate having the sun in their eyes. Can't return them now cause we used them for the warmer months.",1
"Munchkin Stroller Cup Holder, Black","Worked fine for about a month, then the part that latches the cup holder onto the cinch part snapped off. It was pretty flimsy.",2
Graco SnugRider Elite Stroller &amp; Car Seat Carrier,"this did a great job for my young girl, quick easy installation of car seat into carrier.  It lasted through her early years, and will get to use again for my other daughter when she gets old enough!",4
"Ju-Ju-Be Changing Pad Bag, Midnight Eclipse",I bought this to match my other cobalt blossoms changing stuff and ended up returning it for a padded changing pad.  I realized that I may as well put the baby on a towel or a burp cloth.  I can't recall the name of it but I found a fantastic padded changing pad on Amazon that we love - look around.  This one looks cute but is kinda small and you can find better ones out there...,3
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","This piece looked great after assembly!  I found out that I should have been more careful in putting nails in too deeply.  Some of the tips of the nails touched through the wood around the front edge of the dressing  pad frame. (I'm going to try to just carefully hammer those tips back in.  Hopefully, the finish will not crack.)I didn't feel there was a need for the piece directly above the cubbies.  I will probably take it off, for it shortens the size for bigger baskets.  Otherwise, this piece is super!!!  It looks great in my future granddaughter's nursery w/the matching chest dresser!",5
Boppy Prenatal Total Body Pillow,"I am a tummy sleeper.  With my belly growing, I was unable to sleep on my stomach and couldn't get comfortable on my side and couldn't breather well while laying on my back.  I was miserable!  I bought this pillow and it literally saved my sleep.  It is so comfortable.  My daughter is now 3 months old and I still sleep with this pillow.  It is a large pillow, but my husband and I have a King size bed so it hasn't been an issue.  The cover comes off easily so it can be washed.  I have been using it since I was around 20 weeks pregnant and it still hasn't lost its size or ""fluffiness"".",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"First of all I live in India. The pumps you get in medical stores look like bicycle horns, and the good ones==there's very little choice (I've seen a philips Avent, a Pigeon, and a Farlin, which are among the good ones, but I've only seen single models of each of these brands without much choice in stores). I just wanted to be sure, so after reading rave reviews for this particular one, I decided to go for it.I did not plan to pump too much because I work from my home office, but I have an oversupply and manually expressing milk to relieve the pressure was way too time consuming. I didn't want to end up with blocked ducts mastitis and all the other problems that come with oversupply. Before this pump arrived I was already battling a clogged pore.If you have a good supply of milk (evidenced by the fact that y our baby is satisfied after feeds, not by the amount you can hand express), then you will be able to pump enough with this manual pump. I used to manually express into a graduated bottle to see how much I could produce, and I would get 2 oz a side after say 20 minutes each and a lot of pressing and pain. With the Medela Harmony I am able to produce 4 oz from one side within about 10 minutes, no pain, no need to struggle. I don't even push the pump all the way.Pros:-This manual pump is good if you are an SAHM, pump to relieve oversupply, or pump infrequently for other reasons.-It comes with an extra bottle, lid, nipple, stand, and cap.-The two pumping strengths simulate the initial suckling to sitmulate letdown and the slower, longer suckling motions of babies.-The suction is pretty strong but it can be minimized if the handle is pushed down only part way.-It comes with an instruction manual.Cons:-The apparatus looks daunting at first with little parts here and there, but it's easy to get the hang of after a single dismantle/reassembly.-The pumping mechanism is directly connected to the bottle and flange, etc., so they come in direct contact with each other. This means everytime you need to use it, it needs to be sterilized/sanitized.-There is a tiny white &#34;washer&#34;-like ring that attaches the pump to the rest of the assembly. This came off while I was sterilizing my Harmony the second time after I bought it. Luckily I noticed it, figured out where it goes and popped it back on. Without this washer the suction refused to work. So watch out for the tiny parts.",5
"Dream On Me, 3 in 1 Portable Convertible Crib, Cherry",Our nieces bedroom is small.  You add all the other furniture and the space became tight.  This Crib was an excellant purchase.  All the pieces were there and assembly wasn't too bad.  The crib is beatiful and seems to be built well.,5
UPPAbaby VISTA Stroller - Green,"I have a the same issue with my uppababy vista several times...for one the vista on the side of the stroller fades off.so now my stroller says ""ist"" not to mention the fabric frays and doesn't unfold the easiest.i spoke with Jen in there customer service, she was fantastic and made me feel as if It was a true concern and she appreciated my business.the director of customer service robin was horrible.the women could careless about my buisness.condidering I have the piggyback, child tray, carseat adaptor, several cup holds etc I have invested alot of money in my stroller to be treated as if I am just another customer.i will email the owner Robert and the BBB as well.",1
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"I got this gate to keep my dogs out of the room. Works great. This gate met all my expectations, and then some. Arrived quickly. very easy to install!",5
Eddie Bauer Soothing Comfort Bouncenette,"We bought this product used before the baby was born and it has been a hit.  The vibrate option has kept him sleeping peacefully in the living room while the family moves around him.  I find the noises not at all soothing, but they seem to work for him!  The seat reclines fully, great for a newborn; now that he is 13 weeks old we have adjusted it so it inclines.  The biggest negative is that he is about to outgrow it so it is only good for about 3 1/2 months.  A big plus - the zip up screen.  We have two dogs in the house and by closing the screen we keep the baby protected from inquiring, slobbery noses.",4
2 Gerber Lil' Dipper (Sold As a Set),My grandson has a disease called EB and has a very sensative mouth. Her speech therapist recommended getting these spoons. Now he is easting off these.,5
DEX Products Electric Baby Food Processor,"I love, love, love this little thing! I can't believe how well it works and purees EVERYTHING, so smooth. I used a different product and made a fruit blend and was left with chucks, seeds and pulp from the oranges. Then I put everything in this one and it was a perfect liquid blend. I won't use anything else for my baby. It's small and light weight and can't wait until my little one is older and I can try to mash up whatever daddy and I are eating. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to make their own baby food.",5
LASSIG Green Label Neckline Bag - Black Melange,"My girlfriend absolutely loves it. I wanted to wait to have our baby before reviewing, and now that we're using it everyday, I can finally say that it's a great product. Tons of pockets and space, great fashion design.Only reason it's not 5 stars is that there is not really any easy way to attach it to the stroller. There should be one little clip/strap on each side to attach to the stroller like I have on my diaper dude bag... So to put it under the handles you have to just ""hang"" it there by the shoulder strap but it's not ideal.",4

"BabyHawk Mei Tai Baby Carrier, Black/Lime Motifs","Love this carrier! I purchased the BabyHawk Mei Tai because I was looking for something to easily wear my son on my back. I chose this over the Ergo mainly because of the price, but I'm extremely happy with my purchase. This carrier is versatile and comfortable. There is just enough padding to make the comfortable on my shoulders and back, and I love the variety of carries. My seven month old's favorite is a high back carry. There is a bit of a learning curve (especially with a back carry) as with any wrap or carrier, but once you've gotten used to it, it's quick to get on and off.",5
"Combi All in One Activity Walker, Pink","Hi, we got this walker yesterday, it and my 7 month old has been inseperable ever since. He reaches for it if we walk by it he loves to honk the horn and push the buttons. I don't know what people are complaining about the bar in the back for, my son is 31 inches tall in the 70th percentile for hight and the bar don't bother him (have it pushed all the way back.) I am glad to have found this walker on amazon after getting ripped off of one on ebay. This item is no longer sold in babies r us or toys r us stores in this color in my area. They said I would have to go up north to get one and their not sold online. Red was the only color I wanted and the Jeeps wheels don't rotate (at least the one I had didn't). For those of you worried about the price go find something with in your budget the other colors are cheaper because you can't get this one anywhere else in some states. My son hasn't figured out he can move in it yet (he's never had a walker my older son had the jeep) but, he's figured out how to bounce in it and he loves that feature. I wish we could post pictures with our reveiws because I have the cutest smiley pictures from my baby in it and we all know how hard those are to get.",5
"Philips AVENT Tempo BPA-Free Liners, 8 Ounce,  100-Count","I love the Tempo system, because the rings are sealed (since it is a collapsable liner you do not need a vent) and do not leak like the regular Avent bottles do.  Also, you never need worry about BPA!",5
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 5 (2 Mint Green, 2 White, 1 Blue)","I grew up pinning diapers on younger cousins, so I was skeptical, but they are super easy to use, and while the &#34;snappi&#34; can bite if you're not careful, pins can stick, and at least the snappi is plastic, not a metal spike! :) The only thing I wish would have been included was cleaning instructions. I use one per day and swish in warm water and mild detergent after use, but I'm not sure this is the best way to ensure the longevity of the product.",4
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock",We are still using this for our daughter in our Subaru Outback. Mounts with the latch system and you can literally rock the car back and forth while holding the mounted seat. I feel better having my daughter strapped into a harness system.,5

Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"Such a great idea but...installation is ridiculously difficult but I suffered through to protect my child.  I ended up with holes in my nice furniture and a system that will not work.  My entertainment center is a hardwood, maybe that's a factor I don't know, but my cabinets aren't thick enough for the extension slug so I'm at a loss.  Maybe I'll look for a stronger magnet and try again since the damage is already done.Oh well I guess that's why they make wood filler and stain, just add that to my list of a million projects.",1
"Dr. Bloom's Chewable Jewels Necklace Circle, Lavender","I just got my chewable jewels in the mail, I ordered the blue circle necklace and bracelet to wear while my 4 month old daughter teeths. I was hoping it would look a bit more stylish, it does look like a cheap, plastic, chew toy. Although I am impressed by how stretchy the cord is, so as she gets stronger she wont be able to break it. Also it had a slight plasticky smell that I am hoping is from the packaging since the jewelry is phthalate free. I look forward to having a teether that cant fall on the floor, but because of the appearance I wont be buying any more of this brand.",3
