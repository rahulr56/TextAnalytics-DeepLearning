Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,I love this pitcher! It stirs the formula up great! It does leak a little if you don't close it good but other than that it's fantastic!,5
Safety 1st Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,"I use these on the fridge and freezer to keep my toddler from drinking a six pack of Elmo Punch each day. They're a lot cheaper than Elmo Punch Anonymous. They definitely keep him out, but eventually, the strap will break and I'll have to replace them. This is usually because an adult or older child will unlock the fridge and then use the strap to open the fridge door. Removing the sticky pad is no problem. I use a butter knife to get it started and then pull it off. Goo Gone gets any sticky residue off.As far as the sticky part falling off, this happened to me when my toddler pulled on it before it could set for 24 hours. It really does need to set for 24 hours! But, I just super glued the hard plastic right back on the pad and that worked for a long time.",4
Spray Pal - Cloth Diaper Sprayer Splatter Shield,We really love this!  I don't know how we lived 3 months without it.  We don't have to spray ourselves and shoot poop all over the bathroom anymore!  highly recommended.,5
HQRP Battery compatible with Summer Infant 02090B / 02095A / 02100B / 02105A / 02100A-10 Day and Night Baby Video Monitor + Coaster,"If you are in need of a replacement battery for your monitor (and you probably will be at some point), you cant go wrong with this one.  I was very happy with its performance, and I say this nearly 4 months after owning it.",5
"Boba 3G Baby Carrier, Montenegro Black","This is a good quality product. Like many others I purchased it after reading a ton of reviews on everything from the Mei Tei to Beco to Ergo. I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't get it to fit me comfortably which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. I am 5' 2&#34;. Also, the black material (Kangaroo print) attracts a crazy amount of lint. I didn't like that at all. My toddler isn't the biggest fan of carriers. I bought it to help hold her on a red eye flight and for future infant use. I liked that it had a lot of padding and options for adjusting the straps as well as straps for older children's feet. I also liked that it could be used in front or like a backpack. The Kangaroo print is cute and gender neutral. Returning the product was super easy - 5 stars for that!",3
Britax Back Seat Mirror,"The  mirror is perfect  with a good review, the parents very well see his child. I recommend it to everyone.",5
Go Anywhere Table and Footrest,"This tray is very sturdy due to the solid support bar design.  My 2 year old loves it, and its very handy for snacks or coloring during longer rides.  His legs aren't long enough for the foot rest yet, even at the shortest setting, but it should be useful soon.  The table/support bar remove easily from the base when not in use. I use this with the Graco Nautalius which has good arm rests for the tray to sit on, but it should work well without the arm rests too. I have not tried the other attachements yet (table clamp and ground spike.  My only complaint is the price. All the pieces are plastic, though well made.  After shipping, I paid almost $80, which seems more than a little steep. Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars.",4

Bonaco Caboose Travel Potty - The Diaper Potty,"We bought this to keep in the &#34;stow'n'go&#34; compartment of our van. It fits great along with a small package of size 5 diapers. The website says you can use any size diaper, but so far the fours and fives are the only ones that are really large enough.For the most part, it has worked well. We've had a couple of instance where urine somehow ended up between the diaper and the potty, which is extra gross to deal with but doesn't happen often enough for us to stop using the potty. You also need to wait a few minutes for the urine to soak into the diaper before you can wad everything up and pitch it.I have found that the diaper does NOT want to stay in place. It moves easily and slips out from under the side guards pretty often. It hasn't really effected the performance of the potty, but I'm going to put the rough half of a piece of velcro in the bottom of it and see if that helps.As mentioned in the title, this potty is very small. It's about the size of a thick, hardcover book. It's also very sturdy, though. With some careful maneuvering, I have used it in an emergency with no issues (and I weigh close to 200 pounds). Sometimes if my daughters sit down too quickly, the halves of the potty slide apart, but, once again, it doesn't happen often enough to be  huge issue.Overall, we're happy with our travel potty (and the gas station stops it saves us on long trips) and I expect we'll get many years of use from it.",4
Safety 1st 2 Pack Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,"My one year old has had a blast unloading our vertical spice cabinet, which is located next to the stove and pulls out like a drawer.  The standard cabinet locks don't fit, so I searched and found this product.  My husband installed it and solved the problem!  Make sure to clean the surface with rubbing alcohol before applying the adhesive.  My husband is a chemist and does that before applying any adhesive to a surface.  We have never had a problem with adhesives holding.",5

Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"So I had this on my registry on another site, and am sad to say that each time I rec'd this product (3x within the span of a week) the mattress was defective.  I contacted Graco, and they told me that they could get me a new mattress in over a month... anyway, I'm frustrated with the mattress pad because it has several dents the size of a baby's head, which seems like a huge suffocation risk!  There is no way I would let my baby sleep on this.  I am hoping that there are other pack and plays that do not have mattress pads that are lumpy and saggy. I'm now wondering if I should go with another brand or another model?",1
